=======================================
SIML (Simple Item Markup Language) v0.1
=======================================

SIML is a strict, line-oriented subset of YAML 1.2 designed so that a streaming
reference parser can be written in short, clean ANSI C and that it can be
**perfectly round-tripped**, such that a parser can 1:1 regenerate the input
byte-by-byte.

Requirements Language
=====================

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
capitals, as shown here.

Byte lengths
------------

All maximum lengths in this specification are measured in **bytes** of the
UTF-8 encoded input, unless explicitly stated otherwise.


1. Data model (semantic layer)
==============================

A SIML file is a **document stream**: it MAY contain zero or more documents
separated by ``---`` lines.

Each document MUST be exactly one node of one of these kinds:

* **Mapping**: ordered list of (key → value) entries
* **Sequence**: ordered list of values

If present:

* A document mapping MUST have at least one entry.
* A document sequence MUST have at least one item.


2. Concrete syntax and round-tripping
=====================================

SIML defines a **concrete syntax** that includes both structure and trivia.
A conforming round-tripping parser MUST preserve:

* document order
* mapping entry order
* sequence item order
* for each scalar: its exact text content
* for each node: whether it was written as:
  - plain scalar vs literal block scalar
  - block sequence vs flow sequence
* all **comment lines**, **exactly** as they appeared, including indentation and
  spacing.
* for each **inline comment**, the exact number of spaces that preceded the
  comment ``#`` on that line (see 5.2).

Because SIML mandates **canonical structural formatting**, a serializer never
has to “choose formatting”: it only replays stored comment lines and prints
structure in the only allowed way. Therefore parse→serialize MUST be
byte-for-byte identical for any valid ``.siml`` file.


3. Encoding, line endings, whitespace
=====================================

3.1 Encoding
------------

* Input MUST be UTF-8 text and MUST NOT contain a BOM.

3.2 Line endings (LF only)
--------------------------

SIML uses **LF** line endings only.

* Every line MUST end with a single ``\n`` (LF).
* The byte sequence ``\r\n`` (CRLF) MUST NOT appear anywhere in a ``.siml`` file
  and MUST cause a parsing error.
* A standalone ``\r`` (CR) MUST NOT appear anywhere in a ``.siml`` file and MUST
  cause a parsing error.
* A final non-empty line without a terminating ``\n`` MUST cause a parsing error.

(Implementation note: a streaming parser can enforce this by rejecting any
input line that ends with ``\r\n`` or contains ``\r`` before the terminating
``\n``; it must also detect and reject a final non-empty line without ``\n``.)

For perfect round-trip:

* A conforming serializer MUST emit ``\n`` as the line terminator for all lines.

3.3 Indentation
---------------

* Indentation MUST be spaces only (``0x20``), never tabs.
* Indentation MUST be exactly two spaces per nesting level (0, 2, 4, 6, …).

SIML uses indentation only for **block mappings**, **block sequences**, and
**literal block scalar content**.

Tabs:

* Outside literal block scalar content (section 7.2), a tab byte (``0x09``)
  MUST NOT appear anywhere and MUST cause a parsing error.
* Inside literal block scalar content, tab bytes MAY appear as part of the
  scalar text.

3.4 Forbidden blank lines and whitespace-only lines
---------------------------------------------------

SIML forbids blank lines and whitespace-only lines everywhere, except that
**blank lines** are allowed **only** inside literal block scalar content
(section 7.2) and only **between non-blank lines**.

Outside that exception, SIML forbids:

* **Blank lines** (an empty line: zero characters before the LF).
* **Lines containing only spaces or tabs**.

Any such line MUST cause a parsing error.

3.5 Trailing spaces
-------------------

SIML forbids trailing spaces.

* Every line MUST end immediately at the last non-space
  character (followed by the LF).

This rule applies to **all** lines, including literal block scalar content
lines (section 7.2).

Notes:

* Lines with an inline comment necessarily include one or more spaces before the
  comment ``#`` (section 5.2). Those spaces are not “trailing spaces” because
  they are followed by ``#`` on the same line.
* In particular, for flow sequences (section 6.3.2), spaces after the closing
  ``]`` are allowed **only** if they are immediately followed by an inline
  comment ``# ...``; spaces after ``]`` followed by end-of-line are forbidden.

3.6 Maximum physical line length
--------------------------------

To support fixed-size, streaming parsers, SIML defines a maximum physical line
length.

* The length of any single physical line, **excluding** its terminating LF,
  MUST be at most **4608 bytes**.
* Any line longer than this limit MUST cause a parsing error.

This maximum applies to **all** lines, including:

* structural lines (mapping entries, sequence items, document separators),
* comment lines,
* and literal block scalar content lines.


4. Document stream
==================

4.1 Document separators
-----------------------

Documents are separated by a line that is exactly:

* ``---``

* MUST appear at indentation level 0
* MUST NOT have inline comments
* MUST NOT appear trailing after the last document
* MUST NOT appear leading before the first document

Operational note:

* A separator line ``---`` terminates the current document and indicates that
  another document follows later in the stream. Therefore, a separator line is
  only valid **between** two documents. Implementations MUST diagnose the
  invalid cases separately (before the first document vs after the last
  document) per section 10.

4.2 Leading and inter-document trivia
-------------------------------------

Only comment lines (section 5) MAY appear:

* before the first document,
* between documents (before or after ``---``),
* inside documents between nodes (subject to indentation rules).

Blank lines and whitespace-only lines MUST NOT appear outside block scalar
content.

The first structural line of each document MUST be at indentation 0.

(That is: after any leading comment lines, and after any ``---`` separator and
any inter-document comment lines, the next non-comment line that begins a
document MUST be a structural line at indent 0.)


5. Comment lines and inline comments
====================================

Comments are recognized only **outside** literal block scalar content.

Empty comments are forbidden (both comment lines and inline comments).

5.1 Comment lines
-----------------
Outside literal block scalar content, a comment line is:

* ``INDENT "# " TEXT`` where ``INDENT`` is a multiple of 2 spaces and ``TEXT`` is non-empty.

**Where comments may appear**:

Let ``A`` be the set of indentation levels currently open on the indentation stack.

* If the parser is **expecting the first line of a nested node** after a
  header-only ``key:`` or ``-`` with header indentation ``H``, then a comment
  line **MUST** have indentation exactly ``H+2``.

  Such comments are treated as **leading trivia for the nested node** at level
  ``H+2``. They MUST be attached to that nested level for round-trip, but they
  MUST NOT push a new indentation level onto the indentation stack and MUST NOT
  satisfy the requirement that the header-only form be followed by a nested
  structural line (see 6.2 and 6.3).

* Otherwise, a comment line indentation **MUST** be one of the open levels:
  ``indent ∈ A``.

Comments **MUST NOT create a new indentation level**.

**Dedent on comments**:

A comment line at indentation ``C`` ends (pops) any open nodes with indentation
``> C`` before the comment is attached to level ``C``.

(Comments do not count as nested-node content for satisfying “header-only … must
have a nested node”.)

**Additional size limits**:

* The comment text (the bytes after the required ``"# "`` prefix) MUST be at
  most **512 bytes**.

**Rules**:

* Comment lines MUST be preserved verbatim for round-trip.

5.2 Inline comments (alignment-preserving)
------------------------------------------

An inline comment starts at the first ``#`` on the line that is:

* preceded by **at least one space**, and
* (for flow sequences) occurs **after** the closing ``]`` of the flow sequence.

Inline comment formatting is:

* **N spaces** immediately before ``#`` (``N >= 1``), and
* **exactly one space** immediately after ``#``, then
* **one or more** characters of comment text (up to end of line).

Additional size limits:

* ``N`` (spaces immediately before ``#``) MUST be in the range **1..255**.
* The inline comment text (the bytes after the required ``"# "`` prefix) MUST be
  at most **256 bytes**.

Examples::

  cool: thing # an important object
  default: 1 # integer as string
  flags: [A,B]    # aligned with other fields
  description: |  # block follows

A parser MUST preserve, for each inline comment occurrence:

* the integer ``N`` (how many spaces preceded ``#``), and
* the comment text (everything after the required single space after ``#``).

Value storage rules with inline comments:

* The stored value is the text before the inline comment, with trailing spaces
  removed (those trailing spaces are exactly the ``N`` spaces before ``#``).

Notes:

* In a plain scalar value, a ``#`` that is NOT preceded by whitespace is literal
  text, not a comment: ``mode: fast#1`` stores ``fast#1``.
* Outside literal block scalar content, any ``#`` that is preceded by whitespace
  is reserved for comments; if it does not match the required inline comment
  form ``<spaces># <non-empty-text>``, it MUST cause a parsing error.
* Inside flow sequences, a flow-scalar MUST NOT start with ``#``; ``[#foo]`` is
  invalid even though the ``#`` is not preceded by whitespace.
* For flow sequences, inline comments MAY appear only after the complete
  ``[...]``.


6. Node forms and structure
===========================

A document is a single node, but documents MUST NOT be scalars (section 1).

SIML supports three node kinds:

* mapping
* sequence
* scalar

A node is introduced either:

* as the document root, or
* as the value of a mapping entry, or
* as a sequence item.

The node kind is determined by its introducing line and (for header-only forms)
the next non-comment line.

6.1 Structural lines
--------------------

Outside literal block scalar content, every non-comment line MUST be one of:

* document separator: ``---`` (indent 0 only)
* mapping entry line (section 6.2)
* sequence item line (section 6.3)

Any other line MUST cause a parsing error (see ``unknown line form`` in section 10).

6.2 Mappings
------------

Mappings have only one form: **block mapping**.

There are no flow mappings (``{...}``) and no quoted scalars in SIML.

A mapping is an ordered list of entries written as mapping entry lines.

A mapping entry line is:

* indentation (multiple of 2 spaces),
* key,
* ``:``,
* either:
  - **header-only**: end of line (no trailing spaces), or
  - **inline value**: single space then an inline value (section 6.4)

Header-only mapping entry line:

* MUST be exactly ``key:`` and MUST end immediately (no spaces).
* Introduces a nested node whose first content line MUST appear at
  indentation ``(key_indent + 2)``.
* Inline comments MUST NOT appear on header-only mapping entry lines.

A header-only entry MUST be followed by at least one nested structural line
(mapping entry or sequence item) at the required indentation. Empty mappings
are not representable in SIML and are therefore NOT RECOMMENDED at the data
model level; syntactically, a header-only entry with no nested lines is an
error.

6.3 Sequences
-------------

6.3.1 Sequences (block form)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A block sequence is an ordered list of items written as sequence item lines.

A sequence item line is:

* indentation (multiple of 2 spaces),
* either:
  - **header-only**: ``-`` and end of line (no trailing spaces), or
  - **inline value**: ``-`` then single space then an inline value (section 6.4)

Header-only sequence item line:

* MUST be exactly ``-`` and MUST end immediately (no spaces).
* Introduces a nested node whose first content line MUST appear at
  indentation ``(dash_indent + 2)``.
* Inline comments MUST NOT appear on header-only sequence item lines.

A header-only item MUST be followed by at least one nested structural line at
the required indentation. Empty sequences are representable only as ``[]``
(flow form); an empty block sequence MUST NOT be used.

6.3.2 Flow sequences (single-line ``[...]`` only)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Flow sequences are allowed only as a single-line inline value. Multi-line
bracket form MUST NOT be used.

FORBIDDEN::

  foo: [
    1,
    2,
  ]

ALLOWED::

  foo: [1,2]
  empty: []
  foo: [1,2]      # aligned comment

Rules:

* The entire sequence MUST be on one line.
* The first character MUST be ``[`` and the last character before any inline
  comment MUST be ``]``.
* Immediately after the closing ``]`` there MUST be either:
  - end of line, or
  - one or more spaces then an inline comment as defined in section 5.2
    (i.e. one or more spaces, then ``#``, then exactly one space, then non-empty
    text).
  Any other trailing characters after ``]`` MUST cause a parsing error.
* Spaces after ``]`` followed by end-of-line are forbidden (section 3.5).
* Inline comments MUST NOT appear inside the flow sequence (i.e. before the
  closing ``]``).
* **No whitespace is allowed anywhere inside** the brackets.
* Elements MUST be separated by commas.
* Empty list MUST be exactly ``[]``.
* Non-empty lists MUST have the form ``[elem,elem,...]`` with no trailing comma.
* If the closing ``]`` is missing on the same line, the parser MUST report
  ``unterminated flow sequence on the same line``.

Flow element constraints:

* Each element is either:
  - a **flow-scalar**, or
  - a **nested flow sequence** (``[...]``), which follows the same rules.

* Flow-scalar rules:
  - MUST be non-empty
  - MUST NOT contain ``,``, ``]``, ``[``, or newline
  - MUST NOT start with ``#``
  - MUST NOT start with ``|``
  - MUST be at most **128 bytes**

6.4 Inline values (scalar / flow sequence / literal marker)
-----------------------------------------------------------

An inline value appears only after:

* ``key: `` (key, colon, single space), or
* ``- `` (dash, single space)

An inline value is exactly one of:

* **literal block marker**: ``|``
* **flow sequence**: ``[...]`` (single line only; section 6.3.2)
* **plain scalar**: any other non-empty text (section 7.1)

Inline values MUST be non-empty.

Inline comments MAY follow inline values per section 5.2.

Additional size limits:

* The inline value text (the bytes of the value before any inline comment)
  MUST be at most **2048 bytes**.

This limit applies equally to:

* plain scalar values on a single line, and
* the complete single-line ``[...]`` representation of a flow sequence (before
  any inline comment).

6.5 Node kind consistency at a given indentation
------------------------------------------------

Within a node at indentation level ``I`` every non-comment structural line must
be of the same kind, e.g. a **mapping** node MUST only contain **mapping entry
lines** etc.

(Comments MAY appear between structural lines and do not affect this rule.)


7. Scalars
==========

SIML scalars are always strings (interpretation as int/float/enum is up to the
consumer) and have two presentation forms:

* **plain scalar** (single line)
* **literal block scalar** (multi-line, ``|``)

7.1 Plain scalars
-----------------

A plain scalar is the inline value text when it is neither ``|`` nor a flow
sequence.

Plain scalar text is:

* the characters after ``key: `` or ``- `` up to:
  - the start of an inline comment as defined in section 5.2 (if present),
    otherwise end of line.

Constraints:

* MUST be non-empty
* MUST NOT contain newline
* MUST NOT start with ``[`` or ``|``

Additional size limits:

* Plain scalar text on a single line (before any inline comment) MUST be at most
  **2048 bytes** (section 6.4).

The character ``#`` MAY appear as literal text if it does not start an inline
comment per section 5.2.

7.2 Literal block scalars (``|``)
---------------------------------

A literal block scalar is introduced by an inline value exactly equal to ``|``:

* ``key: |``
* ``- |``

(An inline comment MAY follow ``|`` using the inline comment rules in 5.2.)

Block scalar content rules:

* Let ``H`` be the indentation of the header line.
* The content consists of all following lines until the first **non-blank** line
  whose indentation is **less than** ``H + 2``, or until EOF.
* Every **non-blank** content line MUST start with **at least** ``H + 2`` spaces.
  Exactly ``H + 2`` spaces are stripped; any additional leading spaces become
  part of the scalar text.
  (Extra indentation is allowed because it is semantic content.)
* Blank lines (empty lines) are allowed **only** when they occur **between
  non-blank content lines**. Leading or trailing blank lines are forbidden.
* Lines containing only spaces or tabs are forbidden.
* Trailing spaces are forbidden in block scalar content lines (section 3.5
  applies). A block scalar content line MUST end at the last non-space byte
  immediately before its terminating LF.
* Contents MUST be non-empty, i.e. zero content lines MUST be a parsing error

Additional size limits:

* Each literal block scalar **content line**, after stripping the fixed
  indentation ``H + 2``, MUST be at most **4096 bytes** (excluding its
  terminating LF).

Semantic value:

* The semantic value is the concatenation of content lines **including their
  terminating ``\n``** (since every line ends in LF). Blank lines contribute a
  single ``\n`` to the semantic value.

Inside literal block scalar content:

* No comment parsing is performed.
* Any characters are allowed (including ``#``, ``:``, ``---``, commas, and tabs),
  except forbidden CR, which MUST cause a parsing error.


8. Nesting and termination (indent stack rules)
===============================================

8.1 Unified indentation handling algorithm (structural lines and comments)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Outside literal block scalar content, parsing proceeds line-by-line using an
indentation stack.

State:

* ``stack``: indentation levels (in spaces) of currently-open nodes.
  **stack is initialized to ``[0]`` (a sentinel root level), and never pops below 0.**
* ``pending``: either “none”, or a required indentation ``P`` for the first
  structural line of a nested node introduced by a header-only ``key:`` or ``-``

Algorithm for each incoming non-block-scalar physical line:

1. Compute ``C`` = count of leading spaces.
   * If any tab occurs outside block scalar content: error ``tabs are not allowed here``.
   * If ``C`` is not a multiple of 2: error ``indentation must be a multiple of 2 spaces``.

2. If the line is blank or whitespace-only: error per section 3.4.

3. If ``pending`` is set to ``P`` (expecting the first structural line of a
   nested node at indent ``P``):
   * If the line is a comment line, it MUST have indentation exactly ``P``.
     Attach it as leading trivia for the nested node at ``P`` and continue.
     (Do not clear ``pending``.)
   * Otherwise (non-comment structural line), it MUST have indentation exactly
     ``P``. If not, error ``nested node indentation mismatch, expected X got Y``.
     Clear ``pending`` and continue processing the structural line at indent ``P``.

4. Dedent (applies uniformly to comments and structural lines):
   While top(stack) > ``C``, pop(stack).
   The sentinel root level 0 MUST NOT be popped.

5. If the line is a comment line:
   * Its indentation MUST be one of the open levels now in ``stack`` (including
     0). Otherwise error ``comment indentation must match current nesting level``.
   * Attach the comment to indentation level ``C``.
   * Continue to next line. (Comments never push indent, never satisfy header-only nesting.)

6. Otherwise, the line MUST be a structural line (mapping entry, sequence item,
   or document separator). If it is none of these, error ``unknown line form``.

7. Process the structural line according to sections 4 / 6 / 7:
   * Header-only mapping entry ``key:`` or header-only sequence item ``-`` sets
     ``pending`` to ``C+2`` and (by introducing a nested node) causes the nested
     node indentation to be checked on the next non-comment structural line.
   * When a nested node begins at indentation ``C+2``, that indentation level is
     pushed onto ``stack`` as part of opening the nested node.
   * Node termination is determined by subsequent dedent (step 4).

This unified algorithm is the normative reference for how dedent interacts with
comments and structural lines.

8.2 Nesting and termination
---------------------------

SIML nesting is defined purely by indentation, using an indentation stack.

* A nested node introduced by ``key:`` or ``-`` MUST start at exactly
  parent indentation + 2 spaces.
* When the next line has indentation less than the current node,
  the current node ends and parsing resumes at the matching parent level.
* A document ends at:
  - a document separator ``---`` at indentation 0, or
  - EOF.

Maximum nesting depth:

* The maximum nesting depth (number of simultaneously-open nodes)
  MUST be at most **32**.
* Inputs that would require a deeper indentation stack MUST cause a parsing
  error.

Because indentation is fixed (2 spaces per level) and structure lines are
restricted, a streaming parser only needs:

* the current mode (mapping/sequence/block-scalar),
* an indentation stack (small integer array),
* one-line lookahead when completing header-only entries/items.


9. Key syntax
=============

Keys are unquoted identifiers:

* regex: ``[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_.-]*``

Additional size limits:

* A key MUST be at most **128 bytes**.

Keys:

* appear only in mapping entry lines,
* MUST start immediately after the indentation (no leading extra spaces),


10. Error Messages

prefer more specific ones to more general ones when multiple apply):

11. Disallowed YAML features (non-goals)
========================================

* flow mappings: ``{...}``
* multi-line flow sequences: any ``[`` that is not closed on the same line
* quoted scalars (single or double quotes)
* anchors, aliases, tags, directives (``%YAML``), and ``...`` terminators
* implicit typing at the syntax level (null/bool/number are not special)
* tabs outside literal block scalar content
* blank lines outside literal block scalar content
* lines containing only spaces or tabs outside literal block scalar content
* empty comments (``#`` / ``#␠``) anywhere outside literal block scalar content


12. Informal grammar (EBNF-ish)

   comment         ::= comment_line
   comment_line    ::= INDENT2N '# ' NONEMPTY_TEXT EOL

   INDENT2N        ::= 0 | 2 | 4 | ... spaces (no tabs)

Blank lines and whitespace-only lines are forbidden outside literal block scalar
content and therefore do not appear in the grammar.

Literal block scalar content is defined operationally in section 7.2.

Maximum sizes (key length, inline value length, comment lengths, etc.) are
defined normatively in the corresponding sections and are not expressed in this
grammar.


13. Implementation intent
=========================

These restrictions are chosen so a reference parser can be implemented as:

* a line-by-line state machine (``fgets``),
* plus a small indentation stack,
* plus minimal scanning (``strncmp``, ``strchr``),
* with round-trip support by storing:
  - node style (block vs flow sequences; plain vs literal scalars)
  - comment lines verbatim in their encountered positions
  - for each inline comment: the count of spaces preceding ``#`` (alignment),
    and the (non-empty) comment text after the required ``"# "`` prefix.

Because structural formatting is otherwise canonical (fixed indentation, fixed
spacing, no trailing spaces, no multi-line flow syntax), emitting structure is
trivial and deterministic, enabling perfect round-trip of any valid ``.siml``
file.

14. Reference Implementation
============================

* Header only.
* Pure ANSI C89.
* No dynamic allocation.
* No I/O. The caller provides a line-reading callback.
* Pull parser API: the caller repeatedly calls siml_next() to obtain events.
